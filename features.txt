SpendSmart: Personal Budget Organizer Features

Current Features:
1. Add Transactions:
   - Users can add new transactions with details like the amount, description, date, and category.
   - Each transaction is recorded in-memory using the FinanceService.

2. View Total Spent:
   - Users can view the total amount spent across all transactions.
   - The total is calculated by summing up the transaction amounts.

3. Simple Categorization:
   - Each transaction is assigned to a category (currently hardcoded as "General" for simplicity).
   - The Transaction model supports storing a category for each transaction.

4. Basic Dashboard Interaction:
   - Users interact with the system via a simple console-based dashboard, where they can:
     - Choose to add transactions.
     - View the total amount spent.

Potential Features (If You Choose to Expand):
1. MySQL Database Integration:
   - Replace the in-memory storage of transactions with a persistent MySQL database.
   - Store transactions, categories, and other user data in tables to retain data even after the app closes.

2. Transaction Categorization by User:
   - Allow users to choose or create specific categories (e.g., Food, Transportation, Utilities) for each transaction.
   - View total spending per category.

3. Set Budget for Categories:
   - Allow users to define a budget for each category (e.g., limit how much they want to spend on food or utilities).
   - Display warnings when the spending in a category exceeds the set budget.

4. Income Management:
   - Add functionality to record income, which could allow for a more complete financial overview (income vs. expenses).
   - Track savings or deficits based on income and expenses.

5. Data Persistence:
   - Implement data persistence to save user transactions and budgets using MySQL.
   - Load data back into the system when the application starts.

6. User Authentication (if expanded to web):
   - If you decide to extend this project to a web-based solution using ASP.NET, you could add user authentication.
   - Different users can have their own personal budgets and transaction data.

7. Expense Reports:
   - Generate reports for users to track their spending over time (e.g., weekly, monthly).
   - Export reports to formats like CSV or PDF.

8. User Notifications:
   - Notify users when they are approaching or have exceeded their budget limit for a category.

Features You Can Highlight for Your CV:
- Add and Manage Transactions: Basic financial management by adding expenses and tracking total spending.
- Basic Dashboard: Simple user interface to interact with financial data via the console.
- Categorization: Preliminary implementation of categorizing expenses.
- MySQL (Planned/Future): Mention that you plan to integrate MySQL for data persistence if not yet implemented.
